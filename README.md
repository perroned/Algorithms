### <a href="https://github.com/perroned/Algorithms/tree/master/Sum%20String%20(ECOO%202010)" target="_blank">SumString</a>
- searches through an integer grid to find how many numbers in succession exist to compose a sum

### <a href="https://github.com/perroned/Algorithms/tree/master/Spiral%20Writing%20(ECOO%202010)" target="_blank">Spiral Writing</a>
- reads a file with spiral written text, searches for the beginning of the text and unravels the message in a backward spiral

### <a href="https://github.com/perroned/Algorithms/tree/master/Pretty%20Printer%20(ECOO%201988)" target="_blank">Pretty Printer</a>
- a source code formatter. Receives source code from an input file and formats the text

### <a href="https://github.com/perroned/Algorithms/tree/master/Framing%20Squares%20(ECOO%202010)" target="_blank">Framing Squares</a>
- receives a set of integer dimensions used to construct an image frame

### <a href="https://github.com/perroned/Algorithms/tree/master/Ceasar%20Cipher%20(ECOO%202004)" target="_blank">Ceasar Cipher</a>
- reads Ceasar Cipher encrypted text from a file and decrypts it

### <a href="https://github.com/perroned/Algorithms/tree/master/Roman%20Addition%20(ECOO%202010)" target="_blank">Roman Addition</a>
- receives Roman Numerals and converts them to decimal to calculate the sum and display it in Roman Numerals

### <a href="https://github.com/perroned/Algorithms/tree/master/Kth%20Digit%20Beginning%20at%20N%20(ECOO%201995)" target="_blank">Kth Digit</a>
- receives 2 digits (N and K), and will find the K'th digit of the arithmetic counting sequence beginning at N
